# Hello folks 👋 

I am Daniel, a software engineer with over ten years of professional experience. I am most passionate about frontend development with Angular & React. I love working with AWS and have a weakness for splendid UI/UX. Besides working full-time, I am building two side hustles which will be #buildinpublic soon. In my spare time, I am flying planes for fun ✈️
